# Digital-Twins-In-Real-Time-using-Low-Cost-Microcontrollers
Simulink examples and Real-Time implementation models used in the book chapter "Digital Twins In Real-Time using Low Cost Microcontrollers", focusing on the Texas Instruments C2000 platform (F28379D Launchpad.

This repository contains the Simulink models and implementation examples developed as part of the book chapter.

The chapter presents a reproducible and modular approach for deploying Real-Time Simulationimplementations on low-cost embedded systems, specifically the Texas Instruments C2000 microcontroller family.
